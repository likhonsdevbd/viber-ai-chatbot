## The Power of Instant Feedback

We're excited to announce our live code preview feature - a game-changer for developers and learners alike!

## What Is Live Preview?

Live Preview lets you see HTML, JavaScript, and React code execute in real-time within a secure sandbox environment.

### Key Features

1. **Auto-Detection**: Code blocks are automatically detected in AI responses
2. **Multiple Formats**: Support for HTML, JavaScript, and React
3. **Secure Execution**: Sandboxed iframe prevents malicious code
4. **Instant Updates**: Preview updates as the AI generates code

## How It Works

When the AI generates code, our system:

1. Detects code blocks using regex patterns
2. Generates a secure HTML document
3. Renders it in an isolated iframe
4. Provides clear/reset functionality

### Example Use Cases

**Learning HTML:**
```html
<div class="card">
  <h2>Hello World</h2>
  <p>My first web page!</p>
</div>
```

**Testing JavaScript:**
```javascript
console.log('Testing array methods');
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2);
console.log(doubled);
```

**Building UI Components:**
```jsx
function Button({ children }) {
  return (
    <button className="btn-primary">
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Security First

We take security seriously:
- Sandboxed iframe execution
- Content Security Policy headers
- No access to parent window
- Isolated execution context

## Performance Optimizations

- Lazy loading of preview content
- Efficient re-rendering
- Minimal memory footprint
- Fast iframe initialization

## What Users Are Saying

> "The live preview changed how I learn web development. Seeing code execute instantly is incredible!" - Sarah K.

> "As an educator, this helps me demonstrate concepts in real-time during lessons." - Michael R.

## Try It Now

Ask the AI to generate:
- "Create a responsive card component"
- "Show me a gradient background example"
- "Build a simple counter in JavaScript"

## Future Enhancements

We're planning:
- CSS preprocessor support
- npm package imports
- Multi-file projects
- Preview sharing

## Conclusion

Live Preview represents our commitment to making AI interactions more visual and interactive. We can't wait to see what you build!
