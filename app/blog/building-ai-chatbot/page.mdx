## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, creating a chatbot that's both powerful and user-friendly presents unique challenges. In this post, we'll dive deep into how we built Viber AI Chatbot, combining Firebase authentication with MiniMax AI to create a seamless experience.

## Technology Stack

Our choice of technologies was driven by performance, developer experience, and scalability:

- **Next.js 14**: For server-side rendering and optimal performance
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the entire application
- **Firebase Auth**: Secure, scalable authentication
- **MiniMax AI**: Advanced language model with streaming support
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid UI development
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time AI Streaming

One of our most impressive features is real-time streaming responses. Instead of waiting for the entire response, users see the AI's thoughts unfold character by character.

```typescript
const reader = response.body?.getReader();
const decoder = new TextDecoder();

while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  if (done) break;
  
  const chunk = decoder.decode(value);
  // Update UI with new content
}
```

### 2. Live Code Preview

We implemented a secure sandbox for executing user-generated code:

```typescript
<iframe
  srcDoc={previewHtml}
  sandbox="allow-scripts"
  className="w-full h-full"
/>
```

### 3. Firebase Integration

Authentication was crucial for security and personalization:

```typescript
const { signIn, signUp, signInWithGoogle } = useAuth();
```

## Challenges We Faced

### Building at Scale

Handling streaming responses while maintaining React's rendering optimization required careful state management.

### Security Considerations

Executing user-generated code safely meant implementing multiple layers of sandboxing and validation.

### Performance Optimization

Balancing real-time updates with smooth animations required fine-tuning our render cycles.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with MVP**: We began with core chat functionality before adding preview features
2. **User feedback matters**: Early testing revealed the need for better loading states
3. **TypeScript saves time**: Caught bugs during development instead of production
4. **Performance budgets**: Setting metrics early prevented bloat

## What's Next

We're working on:
- Voice input support
- Multi-language interface
- Team collaboration features
- Custom AI model selection

## Conclusion

Building Viber AI Chatbot taught us that combining powerful APIs with thoughtful UX creates magic. The key is balancing feature richness with simplicity.
